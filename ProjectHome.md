Project for year 4 Computing in the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown, Dublin, Ireland.

Main tools used to develop the game:
  * Unity3D
  * Maya

We were 2 on the project : I (Loic Vauvrecy) was the developper of the AI and Benoit Adam developped the map deformation part and the graphism.

There is a small documentation for the Artificial intelligence part. However, i don't have the documentation for the map part. Maybe Benoit still have it.

A few words about the code :
  * The AI part is in the Asset/Script folder : https://code.google.com/p/lemmings-3d/source/browse/#git%2Fsrc%2FAssets%2FScript
  * The map part is in the Asset/Voxel Terrain folder : https://code.google.com/p/lemmings-3d/source/browse/#git%2Fsrc%2FAssets%2FVoxel%20Terrain
  * It was a 1 year project, but we were in this university for only 6 months, so we did more a "proof of concept" than a real, complete, game. We tried to code as well as we could, but since the time was limited, it is not as good as we wanted initially.

However, it uses advanced algorithms (genetic algorithm, meshes deformation in 3D, etc.) and it works quite well !

Overall, we were quite proud of it :))
